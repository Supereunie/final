  <h3>Yummy Sourdough Bread!</h3>
  
  Enjoy this basic sourdough sandwich bread made with all purpose flour. The bread has a soft, tender texture and is buttery, with a hint of sweetness and a subtle complexity that you will never find in bread from a grocery store. It works great for toast, and of course, sandwiches.
